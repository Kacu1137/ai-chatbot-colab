# Deep Learning-Based Intent Classification Chatbot in Google Colab

Build a deep learning chatbot from scratch using Google Colab, TensorFlow, and a simple interactive interface.

---

## Abstract

This repository presents a step-by-step implementation of a deep learning-based chatbot using Python and TensorFlow within Google Colab. The project demonstrates fundamental concepts in natural language processing and intent classification, emphasizing reproducibility, methodological rigor, and a structured experimental approach. Despite the simplicity of the dataset, the framework provides a solid foundation for further research in conversational AI.

## 1. Introduction

Conversational agents are increasingly employed for automated communication across multiple domains. This project explores the development of an intent-based chatbot powered by a neural network. The focus is on **clarity, reproducibility, and scientific methodology**, offering an educational and research-oriented framework.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Data Preparation

- The dataset (`data.json`) contains labeled intents, each with multiple patterns and corresponding bot responses.  
- Preprocessing includes **tokenization** and **sequence padding** to standardize input length.  
- Class labels are encoded to enable supervised training.

### 2.2 Model Architecture

- A **deep neural network** is implemented using TensorFlow/Keras.  
- **Input:** Tokenized sequences of user messages.  
- **Hidden layers:** Fully connected dense layers with ReLU activation.  
- **Output:** Softmax activation to classify intents.  
- **Training summary:** Use `model.summary()` in notebook to visualize the architecture and layer parameters.  
- The architecture is modular, allowing **dataset expansion** or **hyperparameter tuning**.  

### 2.3 Interactive Interface

- An **HTML/CSS/JavaScript interface** is embedded in the Colab notebook.  
- Supports **real-time messaging**, **typing simulation**, and **visual effects** to enhance user interaction.

## 3. Experiments

- The chatbot was trained on a curated intent dataset to evaluate its ability to classify user input accurately.  
- Experiments include **user input simulation** and **real-time interaction** to assess qualitative performance.  
- Optional metrics: training loss and validation loss plots.

## 4. Results

The system demonstrates reliable intent recognition and coherent response generation for the provided dataset.  

**Example Interaction:**

**User:** Hello  
**Bot:** Hi there!

**User:** Who are you?  
**Bot:** I'm Zain, your Artificial Intelligent Assistant bot.

**User:** Ok Zain, I need some help  
**Bot:** Yes, sure. How can I support you?

**User:** I'm feeling sad  
**Bot:** Get close to Allah.

**User:** Thanks dude, see you  
**Bot:** You're welcome!

The framework is designed to be **extendable**, allowing researchers to add new intents, retrain the model, and refine the conversational interface.

## 5. Conclusion

This project provides a reproducible deep learning framework for intent-based chatbots in Google Colab. It serves as a methodological example for beginners and researchers alike, highlighting core NLP and deep learning principles. Future work may incorporate **transformer-based models**, **multilingual capabilities**, and **deployment in production environments**.
